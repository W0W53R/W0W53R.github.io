This is an important step. The rack needs to be nice and hot so the dough will start cooking immediately and the overall temperature needs to be hot in order to act like an oven when the lid is closed. I set my gas grill to medium-high heat, and leave the lid shut.","","Next, get all of your toppings ready. You have to move very quickly while on the grill so everything needs to be prepared and easy to grab. I usually set up a platter with everything I need and keep it next to the grill.","","You'll need:","1. Your toppings (cut, sliced, shredded, etc.) including sauce.","2. Some olive oil and a brush to brush it on.","3. A spoon to spread on sauce","4. A large spatula to flip the pizza","","When your dough is ready, roll it out with a rolling pin, or even just use your hands to press and stretch it. Now listen. Throw all of your preconceived pizza notions out the window. You don't need to make round pizza. I did for these pictures, but normally, I actually make them more rectangular because I have a giant rectangular shaped spatula to flip them with. The irregular shaped dough is part of the rustic beauty of grilled pizza. No rules! Don't you feel daring??","","","Size: I find it easiest to make several small pizzas, especially if you're trying this for the first time. If you want to go big, don't go much larger than 2 pizzas per this recipe. That's about a 9-10\" max. I like to do 4 small pizzas. You get a good 6-8\" pizza that will easily feed one very hungry adult or a couple of hungry kids. Another benefit of doing several smaller pizzas is that you can try out a bunch of different topping combos. Kids love having their own!","","Once your dough is flattened out, drizzle a little olive oil on one side and brush it around.","","Now comes the fun part. Toss that puppy (oil side down) straight on the grill and then shut the lid immediately.","","You'll want the heat to stay inside so it acts like an oven and cooks the dough. The timing all depends on the heat of the grill and the thickness of the dough. But it usually only takes about 5 minutes or less. Have a spatula handy to lift up the dough and check it. You'll want to see nice brown grill marks, but avoid burning it. If you can tell that your dough is cooking too fast and too hot, you may want to use indirect heat. For a gas grill with multiple burners, turn off the burner directly under the pizza, but leave the others on. **We turned the grill down to low and it still cooked very fast.** For a charcoal grill, move the charcoal to one side of the grill and place the pizza on the other side.","","Look at this picture:","Can you see the difference? If you look closely (you can click on it to enlarge) you'll see that the top pic is all doughy on top and the bottom one is puffed and you can tell it's dry to the touch. That's a good sign it's ready to flip. Check the bottom for nice grill marks. Right before you flip it, brush a little olive oil on the uncooked side.","","As soon as you flip it grab that tray with your toppings and put them on the cooked side right away. Shut the lid again and leave it shut. The second side cooks pretty fast. If the bottom of your pizza is done, but the top still needs to cook, you can place it on an upper rack if you have one.","","Take a peek at the bottom crust and as soon as it's done and your cheese is all melty, grab a spatula and pull it off. I like to make a bunch of small pizzas and throw them all on cutting boards in the middle of the table and just let everyone cut into them.","","You can make the dough as thick or as thin as you want.

Wash and dry apples; apples must be completely dry before you dip them in caramel.","","2. In a medium saucepan, melt caramel according to package directions. Due to the fact that I live in the sticks, caramel bits are not available to me at this time; however, Sara was gracious enough to send me a picture of these little cuties that are doubly adorable because you don't have to unwrap them, thus increasing the melting-to-eating stage of the apple-making process.","","3.

When caramel is melted, quickly dip apples. The easiest way to ensure even caramel distribution is to dip the apple and then flip it over and twirl it around so it starts to drip down towards the top of the apple. Just be careful to not get any on your hand; you'll probably swear. And if it gets on your hand, DO NOT LICK IT. You'll definitely swear that time, plus you'll be burned twice and you won't be able to taste your delicious apples.","","6.
